We found a mostly-assembled drivebase in the CNC room, and continued to build upon it and modify it for our project. We then continued to build a claw, build a crank (Soulja Boy), and extend the drivebase to incorporate wheels with greater torque. Lastly, we decided to build a tree on our robot, as the throne of our Animal Champion, and made a sloth to be our animal champion.","images":[]},{"title":"Timeline & Design Proposal","content":"<iframe width=\"75%\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://time.graphics/embed?v=1&id=c3da36f867c9da01434fb7159e18931a\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen class=\"rounded-2xl left-[12.5%] relative\"></iframe>\n<button class=\"mt-[2%] border border-slate-500 p-2 rounded-2xl hover:text-sky-500 hover:font-semibold hover:scale-105 transition-all duration-200\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/131xLfmMZo0mfwwfRNe413u2CigNZGeLxaQjnNVUjvSg/edit?usp=sharing\">Here is our Design Proposal</a></button>","images":[],"html":true},{"title":"Create","content":"","images":[],"html":false,"subheadings":[{"title":"Crank","content":"The crank was our offensive mechanism.

Our move function involved setting the four motors to a set speed based on the joystick value. The turn function did the same thing but inverted some of the motor values to make the two sides rotate in opposite directions.
